	  <h1>Awww shucks! It failed to build didn't it?</h1>
	  <p>This may or may not have to do with the fact that this portion was
	  done by a Linux user. The original scripts were made by <a
		 href="https://github.com/ntadej">Tadej
		 Novak</a>, the VLC-Qt creator, but were modified to work with this project.
	  Please refer to the README on the projects <a
		 href="https://github.com/MoCap-Data-Acquisition/mocap">Github
		 Page</a> for the best information on how to fix the issue, if for some
	  reason everything fails and Windows seems to hate you (Linux will always
	  be there for you) please submit an issue on the Github Page and we'll try
	  our best to help you.</p>
